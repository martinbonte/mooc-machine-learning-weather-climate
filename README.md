# MOOC Machine Learning in Weather & Climate - Jupyter notebook exercises

This repository hosts my versions of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) based exercises of the [Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on Machine Learning in Weather & Climate of the ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/mlwc-mooc). The original repository of the MOOC is [here](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/mooc-machine-learning-weather-climate).

The course has 3 tiers. The [first one](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/mooc-machine-learning-weather-climate/tree/main/tier_1) intoduces machine learning and the [second](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/mooc-machine-learning-weather-climate/tree/main/tier_2) explains key concepts of machine learning.

The goal of this repository is to report my work on the third tier, which is about the practical applications of machine learning in weather and climate. This tier is further split into sections corresponding to one specific topic. The notebooks I worked on can be accessed in the corresponding subdirectories or by clicking on the links below. These open the notebooks on [nbviewer.org](https://nbviewer.org), as the notebooks are better rendered there.
